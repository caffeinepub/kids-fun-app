  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via updates to AvatarPreview3D.tsx and enhanced 3D-focused CSS in index.css while preserving drag-to-rotate and reset-to-front behavior. REQ-2 is partially evidenced in AvatarCreatorPage.tsx by adding many new option IDs, but the diff snippet for avatarVariants.ts is truncated and does not show mappings for all newly added IDs (notably headwear hat4 and all shoes variants), so full coverage cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Add corresponding variant mappings in frontend/src/components/avatar3d/avatarVariants.ts for all newly added option IDs so the 3D preview renders correctly for every selectable option.",
      "reason": "AvatarCreatorPage.tsx includes newly selectable IDs (e.g., headwear 'hat4', shoes 'shoes5'...'shoes8'), but the shown portion of avatarVariants.ts is truncated before confirming those mappings exist; the snippet only clearly shows mappings for body1-8, head1-8, hair1-10, pants1-8, and headwear up through hat3.",
