  "summary": "Index.css updates appear to implement new light theme tokens and a solid light-blue body background, and adjust heading/button glow behavior by scoping glow to dark mode. However, due to truncation of App.tsx and index.css, removal of the App-level gradient wrapper and full primary button hover/focus behavior cannot be conclusively verified. Several unrelated “feature summary/state” files were also modified in ways not requested by the theming change.",

      "reason": "The App.tsx diff is truncated and does not show the top-level wrapper/container className where the gradient classes would be removed, so this requirement cannot be verified from the provided diff evidence.",
